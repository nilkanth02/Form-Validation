# Form Validation

Welcome to the Form Validation project! ðŸŽ‰ This is a simple web form designed to help you gather user information with some basic input validation. It's a great starting point for learning how to handle form data on the client side.

## What It Does

- **Username Check**: Makes sure the username isnâ€™t left blank.
- **Email Validation**: Ensures the email looks like a real email address.
- **Password Requirement**: Requires users to enter a password.
- **Password Match**: Confirms that the password and its confirmation are the same.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: For the form structure.
- **CSS**: To make things look nice.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the form validation logic.

## Getting Started

Hereâ€™s how you can get up and running with this project:

1. **Clone the Repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nilkanth02/form-validation.git
   ```

2. **Go to the Project Folder**
   ```bash
   cd form-validation
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` File**
   Open this file in your favorite web browser to see the form in action!

## Project Files

- `index.html`: The formâ€™s HTML structure.
- `style.css`: Contains styles to make the form look good.
- `index.js`: Includes JavaScript for validating the form inputs.

## How It Works

1. **HTML**: Sets up the form fields.
2. **CSS**: Adds some styling for a cleaner look.
3. **JavaScript**: Checks if the form inputs are correct when you hit submit and shows error messages if needed.

## Using the Form

1. **Fill It Out**: Enter your details into the form fields.
2. **Submit**: Click the "Sign Up" button.
3. **Check for Errors**: If somethingâ€™s wrong (like a missing email or mismatched passwords), the form will let you know.
